# DailyAutomation
General automation scripting is fun, as are bots and scrapers. I like to be lazy by building things that help me save a few seconds of wasted time here and there, plus, building all these is good practice.

### CollegeScripts
Some scripts that I use in my college life. Things I've automated include downloading my college lecture notes (for when I need to actually study) and getting my student timetable (for when I can't remember where I'm supposed to be).

### EventsOfficerScripts
I'm Redbrick's Events Officer - this is in no way shape or form a technical role. That said, It's nice to make the hectic schedule that bit more managable, so I've automated the room booking and calender event management aspects of the role.

### LastFMBots
Tracking things is fun. Music is also fun. Couple these things together and add a dash of sharing on social media and you have my LastFMBots. Scripts here help me keep track of my listening habits and their constant evolution.

### TootBots
Where do you do you're tooting? Why on Mastodon of course! Mastdon is great for a bunch of reasons that I can't even begin to list. I've a few scripts that allow me to interact with it from the comfort of my terminal. Not many so far, but a few.

### TwitterBots
When Mastodon gets uber popular I'll be all about solely using it and it all, but until more people get on the platform I'm bound to Twitter. Twitter is still great and I've found a few ways to interact with it from the command line.
